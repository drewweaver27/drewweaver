                <p>The HitPause app is an app that seeks to <span class="help-p">help people manage their anxiety </span> through quizzes and a
                    custom designed suggestion algorithm. As the project for my senior capstone
                    at Messiah University, I work on a distributed, agile team of 4. Serving as a primary front-end
                    developer with React Native experience,
                    I have had the opportunity to lead fellow teammates in learning the React Native framework. I have
                    also gotten to serve as the DevOps engineer,
                    ensuring our CI/CD pipeline is running smoothly. Lastly, I have had the opportunity to learn the
                    Spotify API while being the primary developer for this feature in our app.

                    technolgies such as Apache server, MySQL databases and PHP templating. I led a team of three
                    throughout the semester as we built this application using agile practies. At the end of each two
                    week sprint, we presented a demo of our project to a mock client. In addition to learning about the
                    web technologies, I learned a lot about how to lead a small team of developers with limited
                    technical experience to effectively deliver software. </p>
